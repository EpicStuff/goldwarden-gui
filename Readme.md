# What is this?

basicaly, i've decided that i'm not a fan of flatpak and this is my attempt at getting the gui to run.

# Goldwarden

### Requirements
Right now, goldwarden-gui is only tested on Linux. Somewhat feature-stripped builds for Mac and Windows are available too, but untested.

### Installation

just do `pip` or `pipx install goldwarden-gui`
pipx is recommened, if you want to use pip, you might want to use venv

##### Github Binary Releases

or you can just download the latest release from GitHub and put it somewhere.
you are recommened to then do `python -m venv .venv` and `source .venv/bin/activate`
then do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
